            My name is Akif Ahmed. I am an ambitious individual who strives for the best in both personal and academic aspects of life. I have taken this year to further develop my passion of learning about the fundamentals of Computer Systems both internally and externally and how it all functions together.  
           </p>
           <p>This is my About Me page which I will share a lot about my interests, how it stemmed and my hobbies.</p>

       <p>My interest in Computer’s stems from helping my parents who were not technologically inclined. This was initially a passing interest, whether it be simply troubleshooting software or running anti-virus scans, what can be expected of a typical person. However, as time went by, I started to become intrigued as to how a computer functions, becoming more thorough in caring for my PC, learning about its components and eventually replacing and upgrading parts. My growing fascination of technology has given me an outlook of how logical and accessible technology is despite preconceptions as to its supposed high mathematical barrier of entry.</p>
       <p>My first taste of computing was at a young age through, what is essentially a “low cost, credit-card sized computer” called the Raspberry Pi. This was introduced through my primary schools coding programme as an initiative to enhance digital skills. The use of Raspberry Pi allowed me to develop basic networking concepts like; DNS, IP addresses additionally helping me discover in the world of coding. The anatomy of computer processes had intrigued me into purchasing my own Raspberry Pi after the programme had ended. Through weeks of perseverance and motivation from my parents, I had coded Minecraft Pi (Video Game) using Python with the help of online tutorials to guide me. Being able to achieve such a feat at a young age was with great satisfaction and only drove my enthusiasm to create and develop other projects as my admiration for computing grew.</p>
       <p>Another source of my interest is Gaming; fascination with how simple ‘1’s and 0’s’ can construct an entire digitalized world, I took steps in furthering this interest by learning how to code in Python. Progressing from the basics of Python to mid- level programming techniques. By continuing to learn Python I aspire to develop a small video game to obtain an understanding of the challenges faced when attempting to develop such, as well as how coding in Python may translate into other fields.</p>
       <p>I also ensure that I maintain a good social life. I began taking Judo lessons at the age of eleven in order to learn a form of self-defence whilst also developing my self-discipline, this became a form of therapy, especially in times of stress. Throughout years of Judo, I was honoured with an orange belt; achieving the highest ranking within my peers, ultimately being promoted the captain of the Judo team by the age of fifteen. Having participated in tournaments, I have won six gold and four silver medals, progressing into being one of three selected to partake in an international Judo tournament. </p>
       <p>Judo has not just developed my athleticism and mental toughness, but more so constructed a positive change in my life, teaching me the value of hard work, consistency and reminded me to keep grounded and humble throughout life.</p>
